title: "Why Proficient AI?"
---

With a little bit of understanding of how Proficient AI works, a natural question that may arise is why
you'd want to rely on it instead of implementing everything yourself. While you _certainly can_ implement
your custom solution, there are several good reasons why you should consider using Proficient instead.

## TL;DR

- an end-to-end solution, with which it takes <Tooltip tip="Assuming you're using the React SDK">**3 minutes**
  </Tooltip> not weeks to get a user-facing agent up and running in your app
- minimizes or eliminates the need for **custom backend infrastructure** so you can focus on implementing
  the business logic
- powerful tools built into the dashboard and Admin API including **analytics, monitoring, rate-limiting,
  content moderation**, etc.
- technology-agnostic solution that supports multiple LLM providers allowing you to easily switch between
  models **with 1 click**
- **ready-to-use**, highly customizable and beautiful UI components rendering complex interaction trees with
  support for advanced features like streaming

and much, much more.
